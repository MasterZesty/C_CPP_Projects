## About Calendar in C:

-   Basically three operations can be done in this calendar application. To find out the day corresponding to a given date, the date, month and year are asked. You can list the days and dates of any month of any year. For example, entering 04 2014 (April 2014) will give you an output as shown in the screenshot in this post.

-   You can navigate the months using arrow keys, or press ‘n’ and ‘p’ keys to view the next and previous months respectively. The third feature of this C mini project on Calendar application utilizes file handling. With this feature, you can add important notes with corresponding dates.
